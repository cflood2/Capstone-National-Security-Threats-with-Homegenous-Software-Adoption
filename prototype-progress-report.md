## **Project Overview:**

### **The purpose of this report is to provide the status of all tasks throughout the project lifecycle. The report includes the following:**  

- **Project Overview**

- **Project Outcomes throughout the project lifecycle**

- **Challenges and Issues encountered throughout the project lifecycle**

- **Ongoing Risks throughout the project**

- **Milestone II Key Accomplishments throughout the project lifecycle**

- **Project key deliverables associated with each task assigned**

- **Status updates throughout the project**

**The start date for milestone two started on February 24, 2024. The
first task was the initial kickoff meeting to brainstorm and discuss
tasks which will need to be accomplished for the NetLogo prototype
deliverable.**

### **Outcome I:**

**Researched Scholarly and academic literature reviews relating to
project**

**Reviewed several articles and case studies relating to the project**

- **Conducted a data analysis associated with vulnerabilities which
  could be useful to the project**

### **Outcome II:**

**A member on the team conducted research to develop a survey on the
types of software organizations would implement in their environment.**

- **This research led to the development of a survey to be used for data
  analysis associated with the project.**

- **The data from the survey's was used to perform analysis of the
  project. The type data used along with the variables was helpful in
  using different scenarios in modeling.**

  - **The data captured was used for the NetLogo modeler which was
    considered a milestone achievement**

### **Project Issues and Challenges:**

- **Challenge: Availability of project personnel (work, personnel
  issues, test environment, etc.**

- **Solution: Team was able to meet outside of meeting to discuss tasks
  and milestone updates**

- **Challenge: Understanding the data elements which would need to be
  fed into the NetLogo application**

- **Solution: Team was able to discuss different data types, data
  elements and variables to feed into the NetLogo Model**

- **Challenges: Performance, optimization, speed and latency issues due
  to internet service provider**

- **Solution: One member on the team was able to connect internet by
  other resources available**

- **Challenges: Training on how to program of the use of the SCALA
  application**

- **Solution: One member of the team was able to successfully learn the
  SCALA application to use for the NetLogo Model. The team will also use
  existing NetLogo models from the NetLogo Library or other outside
  sources.**

- **Challenges: There are not enough survey respondents to distribute
  survey questions to.**

- **Solution: There will be presentation and survey conducted at
  DEFCON II. The meeting will generate enough feedback from respondents
  to answer survey questions. The surveys will provide feedback relating
  to the team's project.**

- **Challenge: Data analysis will be dependent based upon the number of
  respondents surveyed**

- **Solution: Will need to tailor survey questions to present to
  respondents throughout private and industrial sectors. Survey will be
  opened until the end of the Milestone II project.**

- **Challenges: Brainstorming on how to put together the project
  outline**

- **Solution: Will work together as a team to provide inputs and help
  build the project outline**

### **Ongoing Risks:**

- **Project Scope Creep: Some assigned tasks currently have been moved
  to the left**

  - **Due to members on the team having other personal commitments,
    (.i.e., family issues, personal issues, place of employment), etc.**

- **NetLogo Data Modeling Diagram will need to be developed**

- **Visualization and display of data for use in the Environmental Setup
  will need to be developed (completed 3/9/2025)**

- **Time and availability of personnel conducting testing for the
  deliverable**

- **Environmental factors which affected the project**

  - **On March 4, 2025, a blizzard affected the Nebraska regional area**

    - **This weather event produced widespread power outages**

### **Milestone II Key Accomplishments:**

- **Researched Case Congressional Report for JBS Foods**

- **Researched Case Study for CrowdStrike**

- **Obtained Report CrowdStrike**

- **Obtained Congressional Report for CrowdStrike**

- **Obtained Common Vulnerabilities Enumerations(CVE) for CrowdStrike**

- **Received several responses and feedback based upon survey conducted
  from private and public sectors**

- **The types of data and variables used generated different scenarios
  for the NetLogo model**

**The start date for milestone two started on February 24, 2024. The
first task was the initial kickoff meeting. The purpose of the meeting
was to brainstorm and discuss tasks which will need to be accomplished
for NetLogo prototype deliverable.**

## **Summary:**

**This progress report covers our team\'s accomplishments during
Milestone II. Our key accomplishments included conducted several
research literatures to help understand the information we would need to
accomplish our project.**

**Another key accomplishment for the team included developing a survey
to use build out metrics for the NetLogo model. Conducting the survey
helped the team understand which variables we could use for our NetLogo
data model.**

**We also encountered several issues and challenges associated with our
project. For example, some of the issues we encountered included
availability of personnel, loss of power and understanding the data to
generate different scenarios for data modeling. The team was able to
overcome these obstacles by conducting meetings to discuss ongoing
issues and assigned tasks for the milestone II deliverable.**
