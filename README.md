# **Executive Summary:**

&nbsp; Modern infrastructure enables adversaries to disable entire companies or agencies with a single attack. This problem amplifies when a single company dominates specific industries or services, such as banking or food production. This paper attempts to create policy recommendations and a new cybersecurity theory addressing cybersecurity risks associated with highly consolidated industries and horizontal software assimilation Such as EPIC or CrowdStrike. If company A produces 75% of poultry for a nation, what happens if the company gets hacked? How long could the company shut down before people began to starve?  
<br/>
&nbsp; The risk to National Security&mdash;and stability, for that matter&mdash;is clear. Addressing this new risk is important when the Federal Trade Commission examines mergers and acquisitions between large companies in addition to companies accounting for this risk in the decision-making process.  
<br/>
&nbsp; This paper will assess past incidents and use analogous examples to create evidence for use in a NIST CSWP. This paper will also propose addendums to the Sherman Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, or Clayton Act.

### Objectives:
- Conduct case study on CrowdStrike incident
- Conduct case study on SolarWinds Incident
- Conduct case study on Ukraine cyber war
- Conduct case study on EPIC
- Create and/or simulate the reach of an incident using NetLogo
- Address supply chain management concerns
  
### Goals:
- Create guidelines for software adoption to add to existing policy
- Create guidelines for the USFG to consider in M&A filings


On July 19, 2024, the company known as CrowdStrike implemented a change in their software, which wreaked havoc and system outages among window systems nationwide. The  outage impacted several industries such as the  airlines, banking industries, hospitals, and a host of other businesses.  The error occurred when an update to CrowdStrike sensory, known as Falcon,  updated a logic error which triggered a system security flaw in their software. This security flaw caused millions of system outages and caused $5.4 billion dollars in damage. 

A report was conducted which concluded CrowdStrike did not follow proper procedures and protocols in reducing risk nor mitigated the software development lifecycle process.

In February 2022, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published Special Publications (SP) 800-218  Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF) v1.1: Recommendations for Mitigating the Risk of Software Vulnerabilities. The purpose of the publication is to follow guidance and incorporate industry best practices and standards throughout the development lifecycle. 
The Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP) in 2002 published a Developer Guide for application and system developers to follow best practices in developing a secure Software Assurance Model.  The Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM) is another software model which can be used in both the public and private sector. The objective of the SAMM model can be a compliance model in supporting the complete software lifecycle. The SAMM model can be broken down into five categories: Governance, Design, Implementation, Verification and Operations.

### Problem Statement:  
In recent years, there have been increased software vulnerabilities in both the public and private sectors. Implementing a standardized software plan play a vital role in bridging the gap between software assurance and cyber security. The plan of action include implementing security in the design phase, identifying gaps between software assurance and cybersecurity and understanding risk factors within the software assurance domain.

There are several industry standards and best practices software model frameworks for both the public and private sectors to use for software adoption. The government is required to follow strict guidance while maintaining industry best practice and standards in software assurance. Industries in both the public and private sectors not only must follow rules and strict guidelines but must be held accountable when making information in the software development lifecycle. 


### Project Goals:  
To implement the following in the software assurance process:

#### To Review the following:
 -Case Studies
 -Attack Models
 -Risk Analysis
#### Implementation
#### Project Objectives:
To implement a secure baseline throughout the software development lifecycle. This implementation will help software developers make informative decisions and identify weaknesses in their software design process. The goal is to decrease vulnerabilities and mitigate potential risks in the software development lifecycle and to apply industry best practices and standards in the SDLC process.

- [ ] Measuring Impact on Confidence in Institutions by their Use of Software Components

Abstract:
We discuss the concept of confidence as a type of trust, outline existing techniques how to measure it, and discuss the applicability of known techniques on measuring changes in trust caused by software that cannot be perceived by its users. We conclude that the methods proposed are relevant to domains such as e-Health, e-Government, and other domains from the public sector that aim to increase trust by citizens, patients, and other forms of customer roles.

Introduction: 

Problem Statement:

What is the primary problem that the study investigated?
The purpose of the paper’s research is to answer the following question: How can we measure impact on confidence / trust in an institution, when the institution updates its software in a way that neither in-house users of the institution, nor customers of the institution can directly perceive the change. To best of our knowledge, this question has not yet been addressed.

What has been done in the literature review? 
Answer:  Having both the confidence and trust in the tools to measure the effectiveness of in software changes implemented in both the public and private sector.

Why is this an urgent and or severe problem?
Answer: When software is implemented both in the public and private sector, the expectation is for the software to have gone through a strict rigorous approval process, The approval process should include factors such as bench testing, change management review boards, software testing in a controlled environment and following industry best practices for software assurance. The problem comes when these factors have not been followed thoroughly in the software assurance process.

Research Question(s)

What question related to the problem have not been answered by prior research?

Answer:  The research indicated how can you measure impact on confidence / trust in an institution, when the institution updates its software in a way that neither in-house users of the institution, nor customers of the institution can directly perceive the change. To the best of our knowledge, this question has not yet been addressed.

What are the practioners or prior research lacking an understanding of the p0henomenon being studied?
Answer: Tools or techniques which can be used to measure the confidence level and trust between in-house users of the institution  and the consumers who receive the updates when software baseline is changed. A good example is when the vendor CrowdStrike implemented a software change which wreaked havoc to government agencies and organizations. One software update, deemed critical,  grounded our nation’s infrastructure throughout the country to a complete halt and work stoppage.

Contributions Made:

Recently, Hou & Janssen [18] have conducted a literature review on trust within the software ecosystem and in software as such.
They  define the software ecosystem as one that comprises actors such as:
• software end-users who “adopt a software product to make
them more productive”,
• end-user organizations, who “expect that the software products add value to their organization’s goals”,
• software engineers who create and maintain software products in their capacity as talented individuals,
• software producing organizations, who employ software engineers to “build and maintain software to create valuable
software that should be adopted as widely as possible”, and
• package maintainers, who are “responsible for developing and maintaining software packages and their frameworks”.

Investigative Approach:
Vargas &al. [27] point out that software developers choose third-party packages (libraries, frameworks, or APIs) arbitrarily, without considering the consequences of their decisions, unless constrained
by their organizations’ policies.

The Guttman scale was used to as to conduct a series of short essay type question about how people dealt with trust. Trust factors included the following: third party access consumers data, what would happen if their data was breached and the transfer of consumer data.

Primary Findings:
Researchers found the software engineering process requires confidence and trust, as software engineers use software using third-party components freely available on software repositories on the internet.  Researchers also found that to build on trust, individuals, institutions or technical systems can be measured by tools from techniques  as the Guttman or Likert scales 

Challenges:

As public agencies and institutions from the public sector at large have thoroughly digitalized their processes – both customer-facing and internal, they all face the challenge to efficiently communicate to their internal and external stakeholders that they are and will remain trustworthy. This adage applies to agencies from e-Health-
hospitals, social insurances, and other institutions from the health-care ecosystem, e-Democracy - parliaments, electoral commissions, etc., and e-Government - municipalities, ministries, and all bodies engaged in governing public affairs.

Towards Agility in Design in /Global Component Based Development(CBD) 

Abstract:
Component Based Development can be appealing to software developer to distribute  work to different sites to maintain ownership and responsibility of software components. This approach can decrease knowledge awareness to achieve agility in the design process. Methodologies used in the Component Based Development platform includes the following: automation of management interdependencies between software components and related files, the setup of bug tracking tools on a centralized server, using processes, tools, techniques and procedures and creating a how to guide on the methodology of tools being used and having a centralized Integrated Development Environment

Problem Statement:

What is the primary problem that the study investigated?
Answer: How the adoption of a Component Based Development (CBD) can be globally distributing software to development teams. Based upon research, the primary issue have created expectations of how software should be mitigated based upon globally distributed teams.

What has been done in the literature review? 
Answer:  The LeCroy software team developed a toolbox  which can be integrated in a developmental environment and also be accessible to all members of ta geographical dispersed team. CBD also offers agility based upon software development and support reusable components expanding across multiple platforms across geographical sites. 

Why is this an urgent and or severe problem?
Answer: Researcher's argued that it took longer to develop reuse of software components than developing a system. The lack of standards, reusable components and the granularity and generality of components made expectations difficult to achieve. Also the ownership to develop mitigated software independently would reduce communication and coordination efforts. Other challenges include each site having specialized experience in a different domain or market (e.g. site A specializes in the banking sector while site B specializes in the insurance sector. This could hinder the development of neighboring sectors and implementation of agility in the software design that offers future integration of existing solutions

Research Question(s)

What question related to the problem have not been answered by prior research?
Answer:  How geographically software development teams do not communicate effectively across different industry and government sectors nor have the understanding on how to reuse software components in a rapidly changing environment.

Contributions Made: 

The LeCroy software team developed a toolbox  which can be integrated in a developmental environment and also be accessible to all members of ta geographical dispersed team.

Investigative Approach:
The LeCroy software team implemented  customer-specific components, modification of existing components with the customers system. Members of the team worked across three geographical locations. Vendors of third-party components were located in various countries (more than 25 vendors total)
Challenges:
Researcher argued that it took longer to develop reuse of software components than developing a system. The lack of standards, reusable components and the granularity and generality of components made expectations difficult to achieve. Also the ownership to develop mitigated software independently would reduce communication and coordination efforts. Other challenges include each site having specialized experience in a different domain or market (e.g. site A specializes in the banking sector while site B specializes in the insurance sector. This could hinder the development of neighboring sectors and implementation of agility in the software design that offers future integration of existing solutions

Implications for Practice:
Supporting reusable components expanding across multiple platforms across geographical sites. 

Implications for Research:
The potential benefits of implementing CBD methodologies in a globally distributed environment are many. Lessons from the aeronautics, automotive, electronics and computer hardware industries, in which Component Based architectures have been successfully employed for setting up globally distributed design and production in the reuse of software components
