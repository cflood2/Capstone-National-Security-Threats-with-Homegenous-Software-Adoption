- [x]  Understand core problem related to pitch - COMPLETE
- [x]  Understand what a research question is, as well as Independant and dependent variables.
- [ ]  Shift from national security risks associated with highly consolidated industries, or risk associated with ubiquitous software adoption?
- [x]  Understand difference between research questions and hypothesis.
    - [ ]  I.e. need an independent and deponent variable
    - [ ]  Questions are much more interrogative accompanied by a
    - [ ]  hypothesis--which is more declarative--about
    - [ ]  how variables might be related.
    - [ ]  Understand 'exploratory research' category because by the end of this we will have more questions to answer, not less, but
    - [ ]  ultimately our project should only be answering one ‚Äúresearch question.‚Äù If we can help it anyway.
- [ ]  example a research question might be something like this: Does increased corporate consolidation (Independant) affect national security (dependent)?
With a hypothesis: H1 - Increased corporate consolidation increases risks to national security or H2 - Increased horizontal software adoption increases risk to national security
- [ ]  Two Sections in Paper: S. 1 - Consolidation‚ÄîS. 2 Adoption
- [ ]  The CVE itself would be irrelevant as would updates that address them. NIST and other orgs have more than enough on SDLC already. It‚Äôs about adoption and consolidation.
- [ ]  Ex. Software A is used by 99% of the relevant market. This means they are the most likely target for attack. Is it acceptable to take on that associated risk or is it better to mitigate that risk by adopting Software B in the 1%?
- [x]  **DELIVERABLE: Produce a NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CWSP)**


NOTES from 02/10/2025: 
Our deliverable as a NIST White Paper: encouraging FTC Anti-Trust Laws, Hospital EPIC system
Dr. Hale Feedback: foundational evidence in support of top-level claims. And one backup paper (two linked papers) Guidance for agencies

When looking at the literature/research review: 
Dr. Hale Feedback: Long papers use the reverse funnel method and drill down into broader levels as you need more information. Use it first as initial coverage for topic in Milestone 1
Case studies, countries that adopt systems, vulnerabilities that applied to whole sectors (Crowdstrike), forensic investigations of attacks, vendor lock in and research, start at top level abstracts and then work down. 

Lit Review: JUST collect resources, get a sense of what the space is, Milestone 2 will be more in depth (synthesis will come later) 
Looking for high level breath
Resources: how ever many it may take üòä  
Case Studies (a specific example with outcomes) ‚Äì 3-4 sentences what do they do, how, and why for Milestone 1
Diversity of Different resources that relate to the topic. 
Software Supply Chain Management, Systems Administration Integration, Software builder materials  ‚Äì good keywords for research
Critical Infrastructure ‚Äì OPPD, Nuclear Power Plant, thermostat example of how it could be a tertiary object in a longer line of backup systems.
Biological examples ‚Äì RoundUp, co-evolution changes (Japanese Hornet has no predators in NE US), Red Crabs in southeast Asian island (planet earth example) 
February 24th Video: High level goal, how, and what were going do. Why is it important? Leave time for questions and feedback from the class.
