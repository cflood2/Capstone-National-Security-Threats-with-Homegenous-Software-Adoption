- [x]  Understand core problem related to pitch - COMPLETE
- [x]  Understand what a research question is, as well as Independant and dependent variables.
- [ ]  Shift from national security risks associated with highly consolidated industries, or risk associated with ubiquitous software adoption?
- [x]  Understand difference between research questions and hypothesis.
    - [ ]  I.e. need an independent and deponent variable
    - [ ]  Questions are much more interrogative accompanied by a
    - [ ]  hypothesis--which is more declarative--about
    - [ ]  how variables might be related.
    - [ ]  Understand 'exploratory research' category because by the end of this we will have more questions to answer, not less, but
    - [ ]  ultimately our project should only be answering one “research question.” If we can help it anyway.
- [ ]  example a research question might be something like this: Does increased corporate consolidation (Independant) affect national security (dependent)?
With a hypothesis: H1 - Increased corporate consolidation increases risks to national security or H2 - Increased horizontal software adoption increases risk to national security
- [ ]  Two Sections in Paper: S. 1 - Consolidation—S. 2 Adoption
- [ ]  The CVE itself would be irrelevant as would updates that address them. NIST and other orgs have more than enough on SDLC already. It’s about adoption and consolidation.
- [ ]  Ex. Software A is used by 99% of the relevant market. This means they are the most likely target for attack. Is it acceptable to take on that associated risk or is it better to mitigate that risk by adopting Software B in the 1%?
- [x]  **DELIVERABLE: Produce a NIST Cybersecurity White Paper (CWSP)**
