	> &nbsp; **INTORDUCTION/PURPOSE:** Over the last several years ransomware attack on large corporations have increased. These large corporations also operate within what the Federal government refers to as critical infrastructure. There are 16 area of critical infrastructure from energy to military production to food and agriculture. JBS—one of the victims—Is one of the largest food and agriculture companies in the world, because of consolidation. The market share of the company has created a unique risk to the country. This risk is a single point of failure on an industrial scale. If a cyberattack shuts down large portions of critical infrastructure, say 25%, how long before the downstream effects cause wide spread destabilization or in the case of food production, how long before food scarcity becomes a major problem? Could a cyberattack cause a potential famine?  
   &nbsp; In addition to consolidation, wide spread market share has also demonstrated a potential risk. The effects of the Crowd Strike update mistake in 2024 demonstrated how one company with a large market share can—unintentionally—cause a massive amount of chaos. While increasing market adoption is usually a sign of how effective or well made a product is, in the age of unlimited connection, at what point could voluntary market consolidation also become a risk? Are decision makers aware of the potential hazard? Consolidation in critical infrastructure sectors significantly increases negative downstream effects and creates single points of failure on an industrial scale.  
	 > &nbsp; **METHODS:** Our research team has created a survey to measure weather or not market-share is a factor in the decision-making process when companies adopt, in addition to other parameters. Considering market-share, is this viewed as a positive or negative. Due to staying within scope, we did not cover the specifics of why it was positive or negative. The survey also shows that while many cybersecurity professionals make decisions regarding software, more non-security professionals are decision makers.  
	 > &nbsp; Our team also constructed two agent-based models using NetLogo. Model one simulates a network attack. Depending on starting parameters, the network attack gives a time frame for an outage. The length of the outage impacts the second model, which simulates a food production supply chain. If the network attack caused a three-day outage, then we based our supply chain model on a three-day outage. Low security companies could have a longer outage and vice versa. Small market share companies would have a smaller effect on the supply chain, less downstream effects etc.

## 2. Introduction  
  - Background information on the topic – JBS and CrowdStrike hacks
  - Research problem or question
    > 1. What cybersecurity risks arise from consolidation in critical infrastructure?  
    > 2. How have past cyber attacks on large companies affected national security and societal stability?  
    > 3. What lessons can be drawn from analogous examples, to understand the vulnerabilities of critical industry monopolization? 
  - Significance of the study: A lack of awareness left unaddressed has the potential to disrupt the social contract.  
  - Create a model to simulate single point of failure. Calculate how may days food production would need to stop before starvation conditions become a risk. 
  - **THESIS** Consolidation in critical infrastructure sectors significantly increases negative downstream effects and creates single points of failure on an industrial scale. 
## 3. Literature Review  
  - Overview of existing research  
  - Key theories, models, or frameworks  
  - Gaps in the literature. Are industrial level single points of failure ever addressed or mentioned?  
  - How your research addresses these gaps. Our research creates a model to simulate this gap and hypothesize about downstream effects.  
## 4. Methodology  
  - Research design:
    - Detail survey questions and goals, as well as target respondents  
    - Detail NetLogo model
      - What are the agents in the model? – List agents in each model
      - Model 1. – Network attack, what we are trying to show and expect  
      - Model 2. – Supply Chain effects of network attack i.e. take length of network attack, input disruption time frame into supply chain model. Analyze results.
