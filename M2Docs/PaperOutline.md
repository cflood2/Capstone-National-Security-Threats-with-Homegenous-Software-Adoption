	> &nbsp; **INTRODUCTION/PURPOSE:** Over the last several years ransomware attacks on large corporations have increased. These large corporations also operate within what the Federal government refers to as critical infrastructure. There are 16 area of critical infrastructure that range from energy to military production to food production and agriculture. JBS—one of the victims-is one of the largest food and agriculture companies in the world, because of consolidation. The market share of the company has created a unique risk to the country. This risk is a single point of failure on an industrial scale. If a cyberattack shuts down large portions of critical infrastructure, say 25%, how long before the downstream effects cause widespread destabilization? Additionally, in the case of food production, how long before food scarcity becomes a major problem? Could a cyberattack cause a potential famine?  
   &nbsp; In addition to consolidation, widespread market share has also demonstrated a potential risk. The effects of the Crowd Strike update mistake in 2024 demonstrated how one company with a large market share can—unintentionally—cause a massive amount of chaos. While increasing market adoption is usually a sign of how effective or well made a product is, in the age of unlimited connection, at what point could voluntary market consolidation also become a risk? Are decision makers aware of the potential hazard? Consolidation in critical infrastructure sectors significantly increases negative downstream effects and creates single points of failure on an industrial scale.  
	 > &nbsp; **METHODS:** Our research team has created a survey to measure whether or not market share is a factor in the decision-making process when companies adopt new software, in addition to other key parameters that are integral to making the most sound choice. Considering market-share, is this viewed as a positive or negative? For the purpose of staying within scope, our team did not acknowledge the direct positive/negatives. The survey also shows that while many cybersecurity professionals make decisions regarding software, more non-security professionals are decision makers.  
	 > &nbsp; Our team also constructed two agent-based models using NetLogo. Model one simulates a network attack. Depending on starting parameters, the network attack gives a time frame for an outage. The length of the outage impacts the second model, which simulates a food production supply chain. If the network attack caused a three-day outage, then we based our supply chain model on a three-day outage. Low security companies could have a longer outage and vice versa. Small market share companies would have a smaller effect on the supply chain, less downstream effects etc.  
	> &nbsp; **RESULTS:** When assessing new software, do you take market share (How many other companies have adopted) into consideration? (50% Yes, 50% No)
    	> Would you consider widespread market adoption a positive or negative factor? (17% Extremely Positive, 35% Somewhat Positive, 48%  Neutral, 0% Somewhat Negative, 0% Extremely Negative)
    	> Would you consider widespread market adoption a high risk or low risk? (4% High Risk, 43% Medium Risk, 43% Low Risk, 9% Near Zero Risk)  
	> &nbsp; **DISCUSSION:**  The results mostly show what was expected. In terms of market share, some organizations take this into account and some do not. It is split 50-50. No organizations considered a large market share to be a negative metric. This probably suggests that if a software has wide adoption, its a proof of concept. This was also expected. It is the populace argument of debate. "If everyone is doing it, it must be good." Some organization dont pay attention to market share at all and were nuetral about what market share means to weather or not a software should be adopted. In terms of risk, most organizations did not think risk correlated with market share. This was also expected. What these responses boil down to is this: Few organizations think about market share in any kind of negative way. It is usually interpreted as a positive, which, in a free market, is reasonable. The most reliable and best products take over the largest share of the market.  
	> &nbsp; **CONCLUSION:**  The idea that increased market share, or consolidation, means an increased exposure to risk is a nuanced idea. Organizations are not thining about security in thsi way. It is almost like insurance. The larger the pool, the bigger the benefit. In this case it is a benefit to the bad actors. In terms of consolidation, the larger the company in a critcal sector, the higher likeliehood of a payout. In terms of critical infastruce, the United States Givernment can and should use existing anti trust law to reduce this risk by increaseing the distribution of that critical survaces, msut in the way the United States Military does with arms manufacturers. In terms of software adoption, the most companies that have adopted, the more targets to attack. As a result of this new and nuance risk, it will fall upon IT professionals to ensure their organizations have reasonable protection from software vendors, and that software vendors have reasonable change contral systems in place.

## 2. Introduction  
  - Background information on the topic – JBS and CrowdStrike hacks
  - Research problem or question
    > 1. What cybersecurity risks arise from consolidation in critical infrastructure?  
    > 2. How have past cyber attacks on large companies affected national security and societal stability?  
    > 3. What lessons can be drawn from analogous examples, to understand the vulnerabilities of critical industry monopolization? 
  - Significance of the study: A lack of awareness left unaddressed has the potential to disrupt the social contract.  
  - Create a model to simulate single point of failure. Calculate how may days food production would need to stop before starvation conditions become a risk. 
  - **THESIS:** Consolidation in critical infrastructure sectors significantly increases negative downstream effects and creates single points of failure on an industrial scale. 
## 3. Literature Review  
  - Overview of existing research  
  - Key theories, models, or frameworks  
  - Gaps in the literature. Are industrial level single points of failure ever addressed or mentioned? **Not really.**  
  - How your research addresses these gaps.
  	- **ANS: Our research uses a model to simulate this gap and hypothesize/demonstrate downstream effects.**

		- **NOTE:** Need to discuss Activity/Process Diagrams with Team  
  - Key findings  
## 6. Discussion
  - Interpretation of results
  	- Most respondants viewed large market share as low-risk, and a positive trait when vetting software.  
   		- **NOTE:** The idea of this as a single point of failure was only presented to the group after the survey was taken.  
   	- Consider how opinion may have changed (More research) and also use this as evidence of a lack of awareness regarding this potential issue.
  - Comparison with existing literature --> This specific issue is never addressed in the proivate sector but hinted at in military documents
  - Implications of findings
  	- Respondants mostly view large market-share as a low-risk positive attribute.
   	- This suggests homogenous software adoption will continue to grow.
	- If another CrowdStrike incident occured, it may result is an even larger outage, which means even greater single point of failure, nationally.
	- Case studies show there is currently an inherant time-bomb, so to speak, especially if consolidation continues.
	- Also include what happens to social contract when food scarcity increases.
  - Limitations of the study --> While results varied, ultimately brought up more questions. For example, responses to market-share question positive/negative, shuold be followed up with more research on *why* positive or negative. This project does not have time to address this gap.
  - Recommendations for future research --> Refine modeling, wider survey focused on the *why* of positive/negative views on market-share
## 7. Conclusion
  - Summary of findings
  	- Survey indicated a lack of awareness or concern regarding market-share.
   	- It is our opinion that this is a greater risk than is considered by professional practitioneers
  - Contribution to the field --> Model and research serves as evidence for future legislation 
  - Final thoughts > # Consolidation is bad!
