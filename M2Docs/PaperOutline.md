# Cybersecurity and Consolidation: 
## 1. Abstract - Summary of Claims and Findings
  - Research question(s):
    > 1. What cybersecurity risks arise from consolidation in critical infrastructure?  
    > 2. How have past cyber attacks on large companies affected national security and societal stability?  
    > 3. What lessons can be drawn from analogous examples, to understand the vulnerabilities of critical industry monopolization?  
  - Survey of decision makers, NetLogo Agent-based modeling  
  - Results > TBD
  - Conclusion  > TBD
## 2. Introduction  
  - Background information on the topic
  - Research problem or question
    > 1. What cybersecurity risks arise from consolidation in critical infrastructure?  
    > 2. How have past cyber attacks on large companies affected national security and societal stability?  
    > 3. What lessons can be drawn from analogous examples, to understand the vulnerabilities of critical industry monopolization? 
  - Significance of the study: A lack of awareness left unaddrerssed has hte potential to disrupt the socal contract.  
  - Create a model to simulate singe point of failure. Calcualte how may days food production would need to stop befoer starvation conditions becomea  risk. 
  - Consolidation in critical infrastructure sectors significantly increases negative downstream effects and creates single points of failure on an industrial scale.
