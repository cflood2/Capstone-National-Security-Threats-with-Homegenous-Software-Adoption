### Ask Dr. Hale
1) Difference between report for M3 and Paper for M3? One paper for whole team?  
 ANS: Report is collection of deliverables and evidence etc. paper is a real paper
2) Will we be presenting in class or only a recording like M1  
  ANS: Discussion board only
3) Time limit for presentation?  
   ANS: 9ish minutes
4) Is the due date friday or Sunday night, like M1  
  ANS: Sunday Night
5) Can the 'Diagrams' be the graphs/charts from survey results? Do we need two for sure?  
  ANS: Any diagram will do. More like visual aids rather than specific diagrams.
 

Bring this up:  
Lost sight of case studies while doing survey/modeling. May need to address after M2 or not at all. Others had already done case studies, so we dont need to do them, just use htem as evidence to support our arguemnt. --> Hale: Okay to use exisitng ones as evidence
