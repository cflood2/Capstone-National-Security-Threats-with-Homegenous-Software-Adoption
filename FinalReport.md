# Cyber Risks of Critcal Infastructure Consolidation and Homogeneous Software Adoption: Modern Nuance of Modern Warfare

## **Executive Summary:** (overview of project, reuse from milestone 1, update if scope changed)  
&nbsp; Modern infrastructure enables adversaries to disrupt organizations with cyber attacks. This problem is exacerbated when a single company dominates specific industries or services, such as banking, healthcare, or food production. This paper aims to develop policy recommendations to address cybersecurity risks associated with industry consolidation. For example, disruptions to food suppliers could lead to widespread food insecurity. If Big Poultry Corporation produces 75% of domestic poultry products, a cyber attack targeting them would create starvation conditions for large populations. 
<br/>  
&nbsp; The risks to national security and societal stability are evident. It is crucial for the Federal Trade Commission to consider these cybersecurity threats when evaluating mergers and acquisitions (M&A) between large companies and for companies to incorporate these risks into their decision-making process.
<br/>  
&nbsp; This paper will analyze past incidents and analogous examples to support the development of a NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) CSWP (Cybersecurity White Paper.) Additionally, this paper will propose amendments to the Sherman Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, or Clayton Act for consideration by the USFG (United States Federal Government.)

## **Project Goals:** (high level project goals, reuse from milestone 1, update if scope changed)  
- Create guidelines for software adoption to add to existing policy  
- Create guidelines for the USFG to consider in M&A filings  
- Create guidelines for DoD (Department of Defense) when contractors attempt to consolidate  
- Propose addendums to existing anti-trust acts  

## **Project Methodology:** (specific methodology followed in the project, reuse from milestone 1/2, update if scope changed)
