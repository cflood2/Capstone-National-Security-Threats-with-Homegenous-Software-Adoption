# Project Realization
## Rubric
 - [ ] It is clear that the team has made non-trivial effort and progress towards project realization.  
 - [ ] Code artifacts and tasks are documented well. Documentation is clear and illustrative.
 - [ ] Submited as .md file called milestone-3-progress-report.md

# Final Report: Packaging and Release
## Expectations
- [ ] Polish your product by squashing as many bugs as possible and cleaning up the user interface.
- [ ] Package your code and/or deployment environment for release using relevant deployment solutions
- [ ] Create installation and getting started instructions using markdown in their repository or documentation to detail what an end-user must do to setup their app or product.


## Result/Finding Expectations
- [ ] Summarize your results discovered over the life of the project.
- [ ] Summarize findings as they relate to the original proposal in milestone 1. What worked, what didn't work? Where would future work be most useful?
- [ ] The report should arrange documentation generated over the project timeline in a logical way that supports the summary. Think of the final report as a compilation of all of your work over the semester.

## Suggested Format for Final Report  -  See Milestone 3 reqs
- [ ] Submitted as .md file called FinalReport.md

## Ruberic
- [ ] Team has made clear and sufficient effort commensurate with project scope over the life of the capstone project. Findings demonstrates polish and significant effort.
- [ ] The results/product/app/etc is packaged and ready to be shipped to the customer as appropriate (i.e. results are documented well, products/apps are in a deployable / packaged state.
- [ ] Documentation is consistent and accurate. Assumptions are stated appropriately and/or getting started/installation instructions work as stated without issue. Findings are replicable given the available documentation in the report.
- [ ] Findings from project activities have been summarized at a high level and are presented in a format that is easy to read and understand (e.g. tabular). Diagrams and visual aids are used effectively where needed. Findings demonstrate sufficient work product given the scope of the project.
- [ ] The team prepares an overall report from existing documentation generated during the project. The report includes the assessment and finding summaries and connects the findings to existing documentation in the project repository. The final report is comprehensive.

# Presentation
