### Supply Chain Model
> Initial Conditions: ​ 
> Each firm starts at full production capacity, 14 days of meat supply in the system, and has a food security index of 100 (best case). ​ 
> Shock Scenarios:​  
> Mild – A small-scale attack with 10% production loss and a 5 tick recovery.​  
> Recovery – A moderate attack with 30% production loss, 20 tick recovery, but has industry support for recovery. ​  
> Severe – A major cyberattack with 50% production loss and a 30 tick recovery time.   
> Key Parameters: ​  
> Shock duration: Number of ticks that the initial "shock" lasts. (0-30)The greater the duration, the greater the disruption (0-30)​  
> Shock percentage: Production reduction during shock (10-70%).  It represents the total immediate production reduction.​  
> Recovery rate: Speed at which the affected firms recover (1-50%) per tick. ​  
> Cascading effects: The rate at which disruptions spread to other firms (0 – 100%) The higher values mean the supply chain is affected more. ​  
> Price elasticity: How prices respond to changes in supply. (.5-3.0) The higher values create more dramatic price hikes. ​  
> Shock-start time: This is the tick number when disruption begins. It allows for observing baseline values before a shock happens. ​  
> National security threshold: The risk level that simulates national security concerns (0-100). The higher the value, the more sensitive the model will report national security risks. The lower threshold means that the model will only report national security risks only in severe situations.

## This submission is a .docx file uploaded to the assignment on Canvas. The outline also needs to be on github. it is under Outline.md (Forthcoming)
1) Contains a well-written 500 word or less abstract that previews the argument to be made in the paper. (REVIEW by team)
2) Has defined section headings for each of the sections you expect to have in your paper (COMPLETE)
3) Has a bulleted list of talking points you expect to fall within each section (COMPLETE)
4) Section headings and bullets build a narrative flow that is compatibile with your main research argument. (REVIEW by team)

# Issue Tracking and Planning (Submission captured by GitHub activity)  - Connor  (COMPLETE)
 > #### Ruberic  
 > - [x] Sufficient tasks commensurate with the duration of the milestone are defined. Each task is specific and relevant to the project. Forward progress is made on most tasks.
 > - [x] Issues are all marked with a status tag or cards are placed in the appropriate column in the kanban. Each is in the backlog, finished and in the 'done' category, or allocated to someone for handling as part of the current sprint.

# Presentation  - Ryan 
## Slides submitted on canvas - Also need a recorded version submitted. Pre-recorded, no class presentation
