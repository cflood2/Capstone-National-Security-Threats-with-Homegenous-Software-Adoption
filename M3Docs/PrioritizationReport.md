**The start date for milestone two started on February 24, 2024. The first task was the initial kickoff meeting to brainstorm and discuss tasks which will need to be accomplished for the NetLogo prototype deliverable.**

**Outcome I Milestone II:**

**Researched Scholarly and academic literature reviews relating to project**

**Reviewed several articles and case studies relating to the project**

* **Conducted a data analysis associated with vulnerabilities which could be useful to the project**

**Outcome II Milestone II**

**A member on the team conducted research to develop a survey on the types of software organizations would implement in their environment.**

* **This research led to the development of a survey to be used for data analysis associated with the project.**
* **The data from the survey’s was used to perform analysis of the project. The type data used along with the variables was helpful in using different scenarios in modeling.**
  + **The data captured was used for the NetLogo modeler which was considered a milestone achievement**

**Outcome I Milestone III:**

**Reviewed several error messages in code based upon attributes for NetLogo**

* **Conducted a thorough review of code, had to rollback instance in order for the data model to work**

**Outcome II Milestone III:**

**Milestone III encountered scope creep throughout the last phase of the project due to the following reasons:**

* **Due to inclement weather**
* **Availability of personnel**
* **Learning curve for prototype to be delivered as the final project**
* **Understanding key objectives and requirements for milestone III**
  + **Conducted several meetings to obtain status updates to discuss challenges and risks to the project**
  + **The meetings provided valuable insight on which tasks will require extensive research in order to complete the work required before the upcoming deadline**
  + **The research conducted provided value to ensure the success of both the prototype and graduate research paper for the final deliverable**

**Project Issues and Challenges: Milestone II:**

**Challenge: Availability of project personnel (work, personnel issues, test environment, etc.**

* **Solution: Team was able to meet outside of meeting to discuss tasks and milestone updates**
* **Challenge: Understanding the data elements which would need to be fed into the NetLogo application**
* **Solution: Team was able to discuss different data types, data elements and variables to feed into the NetLogo Model**
* **Challenges: Performance, optimization, speed and latency issues due to internet service provider**
* **Solution: One member on the team was able to connect internet by other resources available**
* **Challenges: Training on how to program of the use of the SCALA application**
* **Solution: One member of the team was able to successfully learn the SCALA application to use for the NetLogo Model. The team will also use existing NetLogo models from the NetLogo Library or other outside sources.**
* **Challenges: There are not enough survey respondents to distribute survey questions to.**
* **Solution: There will be presentation and survey conducted at DEFCON II. The meeting will generate enough feedback from respondents to answer survey questions. The surveys will provide feedback relating to the team’s project.**
* **Challenge: Data analysis will be dependent based upon the number of respondents surveyed**
* **Solution: Will need to tailor survey questions to present to respondents throughout private and industrial sectors. Survey will be opened until the end of the Milestone II project.**
* **Challenges: Brainstorming on how to put together the project outline**
* **Solution: Will work together as a team to provide inputs and help build the project outline**
* **Challenges: Understanding key elements to the Graduate Paper for final deliverable**
* **Solution: Reworking key elements to the Graduate Paper to present as a final deliverable for the project**

**Project Issues and Challenges: Milestone III:**

**Challenge: Availability of project personnel (work, personnel issues, test environment, etc.**

* **Solution: Team was able to meet outside of meeting to discuss tasks and milestone updates**
* **Challenge: Understanding the data elements which would need to be fed into the NetLogo application**
* **Solution: Team was able to discuss different data types, data elements and variables to feed into the NetLogo Model**

**Summary:**

**This progress report covers our team's accomplishments for both Milestone II and Milestone III. Our key accomplishments included conducting several research literatures to help understand the information we would need to accomplish our project.**

**Milestone II:**

**For Milestone II, a key accomplishment for the team included developing a survey to use to build out metrics for the NetLogo model. Conducting the survey helped the team understand which variables we could use for our NetLogo data model.**

**We also encountered several issues and challenges associated with our project. For example, some of the issues we encountered included availability of personnel, loss of power and understanding the data to generate different scenarios for data modeling.**

**The team was able to overcome these obstacles by conducting meetings to discuss ongoing issues and assigned tasks for the milestone II deliverable.**

**Milestone III:**

**For Milestone III, our team focused on completing the necessary steps in the last phase of the project. These steps will include deliverables such as testing and validation, user instruction documentation and technical documentation. All other key deliverables, such as the graduate research paper and other documentation will be included in the overall package as the final project deliverables.**

**During the last several weeks, our team encountered several issues and challenges in completing the final phase of the project. These issues and challenges include availability of personnel, inclement weather to include loss of power, learning curves related to the project and finalizing the research paper. The team was able to overcome these obstacles by conducting meetings to discuss ongoing issues and resolutions to assigned tasks for the milestone III deliverable.**
