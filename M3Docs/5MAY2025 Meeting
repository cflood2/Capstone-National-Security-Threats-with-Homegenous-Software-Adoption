Things to address
  - Packaging/release
      I suggest making a "final release" repo on github. This allows us to include/disinclude anyone who does not want hteir name associated with an open source publication
  - Allocation of time for presentation. If spread about evenly, each person has an absolute maximum of 3 min 45 secs to talk.
