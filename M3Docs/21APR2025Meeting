Abstract feedback: 
“No strict number of words, but should be reasonably short” – Dr. Hale
Analysis should not be in the abstract? The level of summary is a little off—
 set up the problem space, what is the problem, what the efforts in the literature to combat that problem, in this paper we do xyz, and then provide some contextualization on the data we conducted.  High level of detail with the survey, some of the top-level key points of data could be mentioned in a statement that provides why the facts matter. 
Methodology is where it’s all described in detail. 

ACM Reference formatting
IEEE style citation should be used – pick one and stay consistent 

Verbal Presentation
Not everyone has to talk but they should be helping on it in some way (setup, format, etc.) and make sure that all members contribute to the presentation in some way. 
Going to be strict on time limits (15 minutes is what we’ll have) Q&A for 1-2 minutes after. Ideally, the whole presentation and Q&A could be done in 15 minutes. 
17 minutes total is the maximum.
The presentation should have an upfront summary on what we’re doing, our approach (solution path), and then most of the time on the summary of our findings. 
Overall feedback on what he have so far:
In the introduction, no subheadings (JBS, CrowdStrike)  should be in the methodology
Abstract – typically no more than 1-2 paragraphs, no specific details should be in there. 
Zotero has an add-on for Word that you can add references with subscripts. So anytime there’s a point in the document just “ [ref] “ and then go back in at the very end. Use a reference manager at the very end.  citation manger Zotero (word processing plug-in) is very good  
Re-grading for the instruction manual 
He’s not sure yet.
